# Simple Custom GPT JARVIS Chatbot Interface
Welcome to the Simple Custom GPT JARVIS Chatbot Interface! This project leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to create a responsive and interactive chatbot. The chatbot uses Python for API calls to OpenAI and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the local web interface.

Prerequisites
Before you start, you'll need an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, you can obtain it by signing up on the OpenAI website.

Setup
Clone the repository: Use git clone to clone this repository to your local machine.

Install Python dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary Python dependencies using pip. The command is pip install -r requirements.txt.

Set up the .env file: In the project root directory, there's a folder named config. Inside this folder, you'll find a file named .env.example. This is where you'll store your OpenAI API key.

Enter your OpenAI API key: Open the .env.example file and enter your OpenAI API key in the following format:

makefile
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
Replace your-api-key-here with your actual OpenAI API key. Save the file as .env.

Running the Chatbot
Once you've set up your .env file with your OpenAI API key, you're ready to run the chatbot. Use Python to start the application. The command is python app.py.

The chatbot will start and will be accessible at http://localhost:5000 (or whichever port you've configured). You can now start interacting with it. Enjoy the conversation!
