<h2> Prerequisites:</h2>
Before you start, you'll need an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, you can obtain it by signing up on the OpenAI website.

Set up the .env file: In the project root directory, there's a folder named config. Inside this folder, you'll find a file named .env.example. This is where you'll store your OpenAI API key.

Enter your OpenAI API key: Open the .env file and enter your OpenAI API key. 
Read the README.txt for instructions.

<h2> Running the Chatbot:</h2>
Once you've set up your .env file with your OpenAI API key, you're ready to run the chatbot. 
Run the chatbot.py file

The chatbot will start and will be accessible at http://localhost:5000 (or whichever port you've configured). You can now start interacting with it. Enjoy the conversation!
